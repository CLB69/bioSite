                      Angie grew up in Marysville, KS, which is also known as Black Squirrel City. Marysville inherrited this name due to the large amount of black squirrels in the city. The population of Mayrsville is approximately around 4,000 people but the black squirrel population is probably double that. Marysville has always been known as Black Squirrel City. The folklore was that in the early 1900’s a carnival came to town, and the carnival brought two Black Squirrels – one male and one female, and a small boy let them out and they’ve been there ever since.
